A dashboard will be a single snapshot that records listening data for the past day, week, month, and year, which they can share onto a community blog page. This community blog page will feature blog posts as usual, with users able to create, edit, and view other people’s posts. On these posts, users will be able to submit a title, write their thoughts, and/or simply attach snapshots of their listening data of their choice.",
